        <p>
            In this program you will make the avatar collect the yellow "pickups" and keep track of how many are collected in a variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will then display the total on the canvas<br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> <i>You only need to edit the game.js file, but you can and should look at the other two .js files.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This game contains a game object with collision detection capabilities.
            The collision method is called "overlaps()"<br>
            REMINDER:<i>(a method is a function in an object).</i><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read the notes in the game.js file</li>
                <li>Comments labeled INSTRUCTIONS are the ones prompting you to write JavaScript</li>
                <li>Write your JavaScript below the INSTRUCTIONS comments</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is an example pickup which is blue. The code for picking it up is already programmed so that you can see how the overlaps() method works
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need to research how to display text on the screen
